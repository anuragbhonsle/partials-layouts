Hey there!
This is a simple, clean, and minimal portfolio website built using Express.js, EJS templating, and a touch of Bootstrap for layout and styling.

It's not my "official" portfolio, but more like a practice project to experiment with EJS partials, server-side routing, and component-based design using good ol' HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of Node.js.
