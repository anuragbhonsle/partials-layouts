Hey there!
This is a simple, clean, and minimal portfolio website built using Express.js, EJS templating, and a touch of Bootstrap for layout and styling. It's not my "official" portfolio, but more like a practice project to experiment with EJS partials, server-side routing, and component-based design using good ol' HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of Node.js.

Tech Stack -

Node.js, Express.js, EJS, Bootstrap 5, HTML/CSS

Notes -

This is a simple personal site â€” no database, no form logic (yet).

Great for beginners learning Express + EJS structure.

Can be upgraded into a dynamic portfolio with MongoDB, file uploads, or email handlin
